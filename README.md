# Overview
This is a project I created to learn about Kotlin and Mobile app development. I decided on Kotlin and used Android studios to make it. 
It is a very basic ToDo style app where you can add and delete items as they are completed. Throughout this project I learned a lot about Gradle and the different files needed
to make the app work.
